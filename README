REQUIREMENTS:
Any platform, just install java and ant. 
For me (Fedora 24), 
    sudo dnf install java
    sudo dnf install ant

Alternatively, one can open this as a netbeans project and run it through there 
(any platform).

BUILD:
    In the BioInfoHW1 directory (where the build.xml file is) simply run the 
    'ant' command.

    [user@comp BioInfoHW1]$ ant

    This builds the program.
    You can now run the jar located in the dist directory by calling 
    'java -jar' on it.

[user@comp BioInfoHW1]$ java -jar ./dist/BioInformatics1.jar -l gene1.fasta gene2.fasta -w50

You can enter -l for local alignment or -g for global followed by the file
locations of the two fasta files. You can also optionally change the output
width from the default 50 character by specifying "-wNUMBER" where NUMBER is the
the number of characters to specify the width.
